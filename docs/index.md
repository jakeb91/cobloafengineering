# Cobloaf Engineering

![We've tried nothing and we're all out of ideas!](outofideas.webp){ align=right }

- Do you work in the telco/ISP industry?
- Have you tried nothing, and you're all out of ideas?
- Do you work for an Internal IT Department, Managed Service Provider or Internet Service Provider?

If so, this page will help you actually troubleshoot a problem, and whether or not you should _really_ escalate that issue to engineering.

For any hurt feelings or concerns, please forward your concerns to à¶ž.
